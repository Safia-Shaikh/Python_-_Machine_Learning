# SHAPEAI PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by &lt;b> SHAPEAI &lt;/b>. The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. &lt;br>&lt;br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well&lt;br> &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7zl8TDRnbulNEA-59W7wWgCWE8LEOD6h" > &lt;img src="https://github.com/ShapeAI/PYTHON-AND-DATA-ANALYTICS/blob/main/YOUTUBE%2 0THUMBNAIL-5.png"> &lt;/a> &lt;br>I got to have hands on experience on: &lt;li>Python &lt;li>Machine Learning &lt;li>Tensorflow &lt;br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well.
